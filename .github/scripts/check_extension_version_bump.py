"""Fail a PR that changes bundled extension content without a version bump.

Update offers from `specify extension update` are version-driven: an
extension is offered (and installed) only when the semver in
`extensions/catalog.json` exceeds the installed copy's registered
version. A content change shipped without a version bump is therefore
never delivered automatically (#4345) — a bump is what makes a change
actually reach existing installs, and this guard is what makes the bump
non-optional.

This check enforces two invariants on the extensions listed in
`extensions/catalog.json`:

1. Any change to a file under `extensions/<id>/` must increase the
   `version:` in that extension's `extension.yml` (PEP 440 comparison,
   the same semantics `extension update` uses), and the resulting
   version must itself parse as PEP 440 — including for a brand-new
   extension, since the CLI rejects a manifest whose version it cannot
   parse.
2. Every `version` in `extensions/catalog.json` must parse as PEP 440
   (`extension update` skips entries it cannot parse), and for entries
   with an in-repo directory it must equal a likewise-valid
   `extension.version` in the manifest (the catalog is what update
   checks compare against, and the update preflight rejects a manifest
   whose version differs from the catalog's). This runs over every
   catalog entry, so catalog-only (hosted) entries and catalog-only
   promotions of existing directories are covered too.

Usage:
    check_extension_version_bump.py BASE_REF [HEAD_REF]

BASE_REF is a git ref/SHA for the PR base (must be fetchable with
`git show`). HEAD_REF defaults to the working tree's HEAD. Exits 0 when
all invariants hold, 1 otherwise, printing one line per violation.

Extensions under `extensions/` that are not in the catalog (the
`selftest` fixture and the `template` scaffold) are exempt: no update
flow is driven by their versions.
