# Add Community Extension from Issue Submission

You are a catalog maintenance agent for the Spec Kit project. Your job is to
process community extension submission issues and create pull requests that add
or update entries in the community extension catalog.

## Triggering Conditions

This workflow is triggered by any `issues: labeled` event, but a job-level
condition gates the agent run so it only proceeds when the label that was just
added is `extension-submission`. By the time you run, that condition has already
passed. Before processing, verify that the issue title starts with `[Extension]:`.
If it does not, stop without commenting.

## Step 1 — Read and Parse the Issue

Read issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }}.

Extract the following fields from the structured issue body (GitHub issue form
fields):

| Field | Issue Form ID | Required |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| Extension ID | `extension-id` | Yes |
| Extension Name | `extension-name` | Yes |
| Version | `version` | Yes |
| Description | `description` | Yes |
| Author | `author` | Yes |
| Repository URL | `repository` | Yes |
| Download URL | `download-url` | Yes |
| License | `license` | Yes |
| Homepage | `homepage` | No |
| Documentation URL | `documentation` | No |
| Changelog URL | `changelog` | No |
| Required Spec Kit Version | `speckit-version` | Yes |
| Required Tools | `required-tools` | No |
| Number of Commands | `commands-count` | Yes |
| Number of Hooks | `hooks-count` | No (default 0) |
| Tags | `tags` | Yes |
| Proposed Catalog Entry | `catalog-entry` | Yes |

The issue body uses GitHub's issue form format. Each field appears under a
heading matching the field label (e.g., `### Extension ID` followed by the
value). Parse accordingly.

The optional checksum is free-form submission data, not a dedicated issue-form input.
Extract `submitted_sha256` from the submitted issue, not release metadata or the
computed digest. Accept a manually appended `### SHA-256` heading (including
`### SHA-256 (sha256)`) or the `sha256` field in the Proposed Catalog Entry.
If both sources supply a checksum, they must agree after trimming whitespace
and normalizing hexadecimal case. A supplied checksum must contain exactly 64
hexadecimal characters; malformed or conflicting values are submission failures,
not an absent checksum.

## Step 2 — Validate the Submission

Run **all** of the following validation checks. Collect all results before
deciding pass/fail:

### 2a. Extension ID format
- Must match regex: `^[a-z][a-z0-9-]*$`
- Must be lowercase with hyphens only

### 2b. Version format
- Must follow semver: `X.Y.Z` (digits only, no `v` prefix)

### 2c. Repository validation
- Fetch the repository URL — confirm it exists and is publicly accessible
- Confirm the repository contains an `extension.yml` file
- Confirm the repository contains a `README.md` file
- Confirm the repository contains a `LICENSE` file

### 2d. Release and download URL validation
- The download URL MUST belong to the submitted repository
  (`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/...` with the same `<owner>/<repo>` as
  the Repository URL). Reject URLs for any other GitHub repository.
- The download URL MUST follow one of the accepted tag-pinned patterns:
  `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/archive/refs/tags/<tag>.zip`
  or
  `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases/download/<tag>/<asset>.zip`
- If the download URL path contains `releases/latest/`, reject with an
  explanation — this URL is floating and not acceptable. Mark this pinning
  check failed and skip the HTTP request for this URL, then continue the
  remaining validations.
- The `<tag>` segment in the URL MUST correspond to the submitted version.
  Accept `vX.Y.Z`, `X.Y.Z`, and scoped tags whose version suffix matches
  (for example `aide-v1.0.0` for version `1.0.0`). Reject a tag whose
  embedded semver does not equal the submitted version.
- Only after all pinning checks pass, fetch the download URL and perform the
  remaining artifact checks:
  - Verify the URL returns HTTP 200.
  - If `sha256` is included, verify it matches the downloaded archive. Requiring
    `sha256` on every catalog entry is follow-up work and MUST NOT fail this
    check when the field is absent.
  - Verify a GitHub release exists for that tag.

Use `curl` for binary downloads. After the URL passes the pinning checks,
require the entire URL to match `^[A-Za-z0-9._~%/:-]+$`, with no whitespace or
control characters. Reject disallowed characters as a submission failure without
fetching the URL. Do not decode or rewrite the URL to make it pass.

Then use the edit tool (not a shell command) to write the exact URL as one line
plus a trailing newline to `/tmp/gh-aw/validated_download_url.txt`. Do not
interpolate issue values into shell commands, including commands to create this
file. Run this fixed command unchanged:

```bash
curl --location --proto '=https' --proto-redir '=https' --max-time 60 --silent --show-error --write-out '%{http_code}' --output /tmp/gh-aw/community-archive.zip "$(cat /tmp/gh-aw/validated_download_url.txt)"
```

Run the download and checksum as separate shell calls, without `mkdir`, pipelines,
or chained commands. The fixed, double-quoted `$(cat ...)` above is the only command
substitution allowed; do not embed issue text in it. `/tmp/gh-aw/` already exists.
Compute SHA-256 only after a successful download with final HTTP 200.
Use `sha256sum /tmp/gh-aw/community-archive.zip` to record its digest as `actual_sha256`.
If no checksum was submitted, skip the comparison without failing validation.
Otherwise, use the edit tool to write `/tmp/gh-aw/community-archive.sha256` with
exactly this one line and a trailing newline, replacing `EXPECTED_SHA256` with
the validated `submitted_sha256` (two spaces before the fixed archive path):

```text
EXPECTED_SHA256  /tmp/gh-aw/community-archive.zip
```

Run this comparison as a separate shell call:

```bash
sha256sum --check --strict /tmp/gh-aw/community-archive.sha256
```

Require exit code 0 and an `OK` result before marking the checksum check passed.
A `FAILED` checksum comparison is a Failed outcome: report the submitted and
actual digests, remove `validation-passed`, add `validation-failed`, and stop
without catalog/docs edits or a PR. Never replace a mismatching submitted checksum
with the computed or release-metadata digest. A command that cannot run or read
the archive is Blocked, not a successful comparison.
A blocked or failed download must not count as a passed check; repository/release metadata is not a
substitute for fetching the archive. Never execute downloaded content.

### 2e. Submission checklists
- Confirm that all required checkboxes in the Testing Checklist and Submission
  Requirements sections are checked (`[x]`)

### Validation outcome

Choose exactly one outcome below, in order. A check that could not run is
incomplete, not a passed check or a confirmed submission defect.

#### Blocked

If a permission denial, sandbox/network restriction, timeout, or service outage
prevents a required check, validation is blocked by the workflow environment:
- Comment with the attempted URL, exact error, and workflow run link, asking a
  maintainer to investigate and rerun validation.
- Do not ask the submitter to change a URL or resubmit solely
  because the workflow could not perform the check.
- Remove `validation-passed`. Do not add `validation-failed` or `needs-info` solely for an
  environment blocker. Do not describe unperformed checks as passed.
- If independent submission checks failed, report those separately
  and apply `validation-failed` for those failures only. An observed HTTP 404
  or a checksum mismatch is a submission failure, not a permission failure.
- Stop processing here without editing catalog/docs files or opening a PR.
  Do not evaluate the Failed or Passed outcomes below.

#### Failed

If there are no environment blockers and a completed check found a submission defect:
1. Add a comment on the issue listing each failed check with a clear explanation
   of what's wrong and how to fix it
2. Remove `validation-passed`
3. Add the `validation-failed` label
4. **Stop — do not proceed further**

#### Passed

If there are no environment blockers and every required check completed and passed:
1. Remove `validation-failed`
2. Add the `validation-passed` label
3. Continue to Step 3

## Step 3 — Determine Add vs Update

Search `extensions/catalog.community.json` for the extension ID.

- **Not found** → this is a **new addition**
- **Found** → this is an **update** — replace the existing entry in-place;
  preserve `created_at`, `downloads`, and `stars` from the existing entry

## Step 4 — Update `extensions/catalog.community.json`

Edit `extensions/catalog.community.json` to add or update the extension entry.

For both new entries and updates, only after every required validation passes,
set `sha256` to `actual_sha256` from the downloaded archive. Do this even when no
checksum was submitted. Replace any previous catalog digest; do not reuse a digest
from an older archive. A submitted mismatch must fail validation before this step;
writing the computed digest must never be used to bypass that failure.

### For a new extension

Insert the entry in **alphabetical order by extension ID** within the
`"extensions"` object. Use this structure:

```json
{
  "<id>": {
    "name": "<name>",
    "id": "<id>",
    "description": "<description>",
    "author": "<author>",
    "version": "<version>",
    "download_url": "<download_url>",
    "sha256": "<actual_sha256>",
    "repository": "<repository>",
    "homepage": "<homepage or repository>",
    "documentation": "<documentation or repository README>",
    "changelog": "<changelog or empty string>",
    "license": "<license>",
    "requires": {
      "speckit_version": "<speckit_version>"
    },
    "provides": {
      "commands": <N>,
      "hooks": <N>
    },
    "tags": ["<tag1>", "<tag2>"],
    "verified": false,
    "downloads": 0,
    "stars": 0,
    "created_at": "<today>T00:00:00Z",
    "updated_at": "<today>T00:00:00Z"
  }
}
```

If the extension has optional tool dependencies, add a `"tools"` array inside
`"requires"`:

```json
"tools": [{ "name": "<tool>", "required": false }]
```

### For an update

Replace only the changed fields (typically `version`, `download_url`,
`description`, `provides`, `requires`, `tags`, `updated_at`). **Preserve**
`created_at`, `downloads`, and `stars` from the existing entry.

### After editing

Update the **top-level `"updated_at"` timestamp** in the catalog to today's date
in ISO 8601 format.

Validate the JSON by running:

```bash
python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('extensions/catalog.community.json')); print('Valid JSON')"
```

If validation fails, fix the JSON and re-validate before continuing.

## Step 5 — Update `docs/community/extensions.md`

Edit `docs/community/extensions.md` to add or update a row in the Community
Extensions table.

### For a new extension

Insert a new row in **alphabetical order by extension name**:

```
| <Name> | <Description> | `<category>` | <Effect> | [<repo-name>](<repository-url>) |
```

Determine the category from the extension's behavior:
- `docs` — reads, validates, or generates spec artifacts
- `code` — reviews, validates, or modifies source code
- `process` — orchestrates workflow across phases
- `integration` — syncs with external platforms
- `visibility` — reports on project health or progress

Determine the effect:
- `Read-only` — produces reports only
- `Read+Write` — modifies project files

### For an update

Find the existing row and update any changed fields in-place.

## Step 6 — Create Pull Request

Create a pull request with the changes. Use this branch naming convention:

This repository-owned gh-aw maintenance workflow does not perform the contributor
open-PR count check or request confirmation. After successful validation and
allowed catalog/docs file updates, emit the configured draft `create_pull_request`
safe output regardless of the submitter's or filing account's open PR count.

- **New extension:** `add-<extension-id>-extension`
- **Update:** `update-<extension-id>-extension`

### Commit message

For a new extension:
```
Add <Name> extension to community catalog

Add <id> extension submitted by @<issue-author> to:
- extensions/catalog.community.json (alphabetical order)
- docs/community/extensions.md community extensions table

Closes #<issue-number>
```

For an update:
```
Update <Name> extension to v<version>

Update <id> extension submitted by @<issue-author>:
- extensions/catalog.community.json (version, download_url, etc.)
- docs/community/extensions.md community extensions table

Closes #<issue-number>
```

### PR description

Include:
- A summary of what changed
- Validation results (all checks passed)
- `Closes #${{ github.event.issue.number }}`
- `cc @<issue-author>` — mention the submitter

## Important Rules

- **Alphabetical order matters** — entries must be sorted by ID in the JSON and
  by name in the docs table
- **Always validate JSON** after editing — a trailing comma or missing brace
  will break the catalog
- **Use `Closes` not `Fixes`** — `Closes #N` is the correct keyword for
  submission issues
- **Match the proposed entry but verify** — the issue may include a proposed
  JSON block, but always validate field values against the actual repository
  state rather than blindly trusting the submitter's JSON
- **Preserve `created_at` on updates** — keep the original value; only update
  `updated_at`
- **Preserve `downloads` and `stars` on updates** — these reflect usage metrics
  and must not be reset
- **Do not modify any other files** — only `extensions/catalog.community.json`
  and `docs/community/extensions.md`
