# Add Community Bundle from Issue Submission

You are a catalog maintenance agent for the Spec Kit project. Process community
bundle submission issues and create draft pull requests that add or update
entries in the community bundle catalog.

Community bundles are untrusted. Validate metadata and distribution evidence,
but do not claim to audit, endorse, or support bundle code or the components it
installs. Never register a submitted companion catalog automatically.

## Triggering Conditions

This workflow is triggered by an `issues: labeled` event and is gated to the
`bundle-submission` label. Before processing, verify that the issue title starts
with `[Bundle]:`. If it does not, stop without commenting.

## Step 1 - Read and Parse the Issue

Read issue #${{ github.event.issue.number }} and extract these issue-form fields:

| Field | Issue Form ID | Required |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Bundle ID | `bundle-id` | Yes |
| Bundle Name | `bundle-name` | Yes |
| Version | `version` | Yes |
| Role or Team | `role` | Yes |
| Description | `description` | Yes |
| Author | `author` | Yes |
| Repository URL | `repository` | Yes |
| Download URL | `download-url` | Yes |
| Documentation URL | `documentation` | Yes |
| License | `license` | Yes |
| Required Spec Kit Version | `speckit-version` | Yes |
| Integration Target | `integration` | No |
| Components Provided | `components-provided` | Yes |
| Required Component Catalogs | `required-catalogs` | Yes |
| Tags | `tags` | Yes |
| Key Features | `features` | Yes |
| Testing Details | `testing-details` | Yes |
| Example Usage | `example-usage` | Yes |
| Proposed Catalog Entry | `catalog-entry` | Yes |

Issue-form values appear beneath headings matching their labels.

The optional checksum is free-form submission data, not a dedicated issue-form input.
Extract `submitted_sha256` from the submitted issue, not release metadata or the
computed digest. Accept a manually appended `### SHA-256` heading (including
`### SHA-256 (sha256)`) or the `sha256` field in the Proposed Catalog Entry.
If both sources supply a checksum, they must agree after trimming whitespace
and normalizing hexadecimal case. A supplied checksum must contain exactly 64
hexadecimal characters; malformed or conflicting values are submission failures,
not an absent checksum.

## Step 2 - Validate the Submission

Run every check and collect all failures before deciding the outcome.

### 2a. Bundle ID and version

- The bundle ID must match
  `^[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9._-]*[a-z0-9])?$`.
- The version must be semantic version `X.Y.Z` with digits only and no `v`
  prefix.

### 2b. Repository and documentation

- Restrict repository and documentation URLs to public GitHub URLs before
  fetching them.
- Confirm the repository exists and contains `bundle.yml`, `README.md`, and a
  license file (`LICENSE`, `LICENSE.md`, or `LICENSE.txt`).
- The documentation URL must resolve to a readable Markdown file that explains
  the bundle's intended role, installed components, required catalogs, and
  installation steps.
- Confirm the repository's `bundle.yml` matches the submitted bundle ID,
  version, role, author, license, Spec Kit requirement, integration target, and
  component summary.

### 2c. Release artifact

- The download URL MUST belong to the submitted repository
  (`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/...` with the same `<owner>/<repo>` as
  the Repository URL). Reject URLs for any other GitHub repository.
- The download URL MUST follow the accepted tag-pinned pattern:
  `https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases/download/<tag>/<asset>.zip`.
- If the download URL path contains `releases/latest/`, reject with an
  explanation — this URL is floating and not acceptable. Mark this pinning
  check failed and skip the HTTP request for this URL, then continue the
  remaining validations.
- The `<tag>` segment in the URL MUST correspond to the submitted version.
  Accept `vX.Y.Z`, `X.Y.Z`, and scoped tags whose version suffix matches
  (for example `aide-v1.0.0` for version `1.0.0`). Reject a tag whose
  embedded semver does not equal the submitted version.
- Only after all pinning checks pass, fetch the download URL and perform the
  remaining artifact checks:
  - Verify the URL returns HTTP 200.
  - If `sha256` is included, verify it matches the downloaded archive. Requiring
    `sha256` on every catalog entry is follow-up work and MUST NOT fail this
    check when the field is absent.
  - Confirm the release exists and the exact ZIP asset is attached to it.
- Confirm the asset name is versioned and consistent with the submitted bundle
  ID and version.

Use `curl` for binary downloads. After the URL passes the pinning checks,
require the entire URL to match `^[A-Za-z0-9._~%/:-]+$`, with no whitespace or
control characters. Reject disallowed characters as a submission failure without
fetching the URL. Do not decode or rewrite the URL to make it pass.

Then use the edit tool (not a shell command) to write the exact URL as one line
plus a trailing newline to `/tmp/gh-aw/validated_download_url.txt`. Do not
interpolate issue values into shell commands, including commands to create this
file. Run this fixed command unchanged:

```bash
curl --location --proto '=https' --proto-redir '=https' --max-time 60 --silent --show-error --write-out '%{http_code}' --output /tmp/gh-aw/community-archive.zip "$(cat /tmp/gh-aw/validated_download_url.txt)"
```

Run the download and checksum as separate shell calls, without `mkdir`, pipelines,
or chained commands. The fixed, double-quoted `$(cat ...)` above is the only command
substitution allowed; do not embed issue text in it. `/tmp/gh-aw/` already exists.
Compute SHA-256 only after a successful download with final HTTP 200.
Use `sha256sum /tmp/gh-aw/community-archive.zip` to record its digest as `actual_sha256`.
If no checksum was submitted, skip the comparison without failing validation.
Otherwise, use the edit tool to write `/tmp/gh-aw/community-archive.sha256` with
exactly this one line and a trailing newline, replacing `EXPECTED_SHA256` with
the validated `submitted_sha256` (two spaces before the fixed archive path):

```text
EXPECTED_SHA256  /tmp/gh-aw/community-archive.zip
```

Run this comparison as a separate shell call:

```bash
sha256sum --check --strict /tmp/gh-aw/community-archive.sha256
```

Require exit code 0 and an `OK` result before marking the checksum check passed.
A `FAILED` checksum comparison is a Failed outcome: report the submitted and
actual digests, remove `validation-passed`, add `validation-failed`, and stop
without catalog/docs edits or a PR. Never replace a mismatching submitted checksum
with the computed or release-metadata digest. A command that cannot run or read
the archive is Blocked, not a successful comparison.
A blocked or failed download must not count as a passed check; repository/release metadata is not a
substitute for fetching the archive. Never execute downloaded content.

Do not fetch arbitrary user-provided URLs. Do not claim the artifact was
executed or audited; rely on the required submission attestations for build and
installation evidence.

### 2d. Catalog entry

Parse the proposed JSON and require one entry under the submitted bundle ID.
Confirm that:

- `id`, `name`, `version`, `role`, `description`, `author`, `license`,
  `download_url`, and `repository` match the submission and manifest.
- `requires.speckit_version` matches the submission.
- `provides` contains non-negative integer counts for `extensions`, `presets`,
  `steps`, and `workflows`, matching the manifest.
- `tags` contains 2-5 lowercase strings and matches the submitted tags.
- `verified` is the boolean value `false`. Community entries must never be
  marked verified.

### 2e. Component resolution

- `Required Component Catalogs` must explicitly say `None` or list every
  non-default extension, preset, workflow, and step catalog needed by the
  bundle.
- Compare the manifest references, README, required-catalog field, testing
  details, and example usage for consistency.
- If non-default catalogs are required, ensure each URL is HTTPS, the README
  documents the corresponding `catalog add` command, and the testing details
  say those catalogs were registered in the clean-project test.
- If the field says `None` but a component is not bundled and cannot be
  installed from a default Spec Kit catalog, fail validation and ask the
  submitter to list and document an install-allowed companion catalog.

The community bundle catalog itself remains discovery-only. Companion catalog
URLs are documentation and validation metadata, not catalogs this workflow
should add to Spec Kit.

### 2f. Checklists and testing evidence

- Confirm every required checkbox in Testing Checklist and Submission
  Requirements is checked (`[x]`).
- Confirm Testing Details describe validation, build, artifact installation,
  and clean-project testing.
- Confirm Example Usage includes artifact installation and, when applicable,
  all required catalog setup commands.

### Validation outcome

Choose exactly one outcome below, in order. A check that could not run is
incomplete, not a passed check or a confirmed submission defect.

#### Blocked

If a permission denial, sandbox/network restriction, timeout, or service outage
prevents a required check, validation is blocked by the workflow environment:
- Comment with the attempted URL, exact error, and workflow run link, asking a
  maintainer to investigate and rerun validation.
- Do not ask the submitter to change a URL or resubmit solely
  because the workflow could not perform the check.
- Remove `validation-passed`. Do not add `validation-failed` or `needs-info` solely for an
  environment blocker. Do not describe unperformed checks as passed.
- If independent submission checks failed, report those separately
  and apply `validation-failed` for those failures only. An observed HTTP 404
  or a checksum mismatch is a submission failure, not a permission failure.
- Stop processing here without editing catalog/docs files or opening a PR.
  Do not evaluate the Failed or Passed outcomes below.

#### Failed

If there are no environment blockers and a completed check found a submission defect:

1. Comment once with every failed check and a specific correction.
2. Remove `validation-passed`.
3. Add `validation-failed`; add `needs-info` when submitter input is needed.
4. Stop without editing files or creating a pull request.

#### Passed

If there are no environment blockers and every required check completed and passed:
remove `validation-failed` and `needs-info`, add `validation-passed`, and continue.
After successful PR creation, the `conclusion` job also applies these
issue labels independently of the agent. It does not run when no PR was created
or safe-output processing failed.

## Step 3 - Determine Add or Update

Search `bundles/catalog.community.json` for the bundle ID.

- If absent, add a new entry.
- If present, update the existing entry in place.

Treat a submitted version lower than or equal to the existing catalog version
as a validation failure unless the issue clearly documents a metadata-only
correction at the same version.

## Step 4 - Update the Community Catalog

Edit `bundles/catalog.community.json`. Insert new entries alphabetically by
bundle ID.

For both new entries and updates, only after every required validation passes,
set `sha256` to `actual_sha256` from the downloaded archive. Do this even when no
checksum was submitted. Replace any previous catalog digest; do not reuse a digest
from an older archive. A submitted mismatch must fail validation before this step;
writing the computed digest must never be used to bypass that failure.

The entry shape is:

```json
{
  "<bundle-id>": {
    "name": "<bundle-name>",
    "id": "<bundle-id>",
    "version": "<version>",
    "role": "<role>",
    "description": "<description>",
    "author": "<author>",
    "license": "<license>",
    "download_url": "<download-url>",
    "sha256": "<actual_sha256>",
    "repository": "<repository>",
    "requires": {
      "speckit_version": "<speckit-version>"
    },
    "provides": {
      "extensions": 0,
      "presets": 0,
      "steps": 0,
      "workflows": 0
    },
    "tags": ["<tag>"],
    "verified": false
  }
}
```

Use the validated proposed entry for submitted metadata and set `sha256` as above. Keep
`verified: false`. Update the top-level `updated_at` to today's UTC date at
midnight and preserve the top-level `catalog_url`.

Validate the complete file:

```bash
python3 -c "import json; json.load(open('bundles/catalog.community.json')); print('Valid JSON')"
```

## Step 5 - Update Community Documentation

Add or update the bundle in `docs/community/bundles.md`. Keep rows alphabetical
by bundle name:

```text
| <Name> | <Description> | `<role>` | <component counts> | <None or documented> | [<repo-name>](<repository>) |
```

Before rendering the row, convert every user-derived display value to
single-line plain text: collapse CR/LF sequences to spaces, remove control
characters, and backslash-escape `\`, `|`, backticks, `*`, `_`, `[`, `]`, `<`,
and `>`. Use the validated HTTPS GitHub repository URL unchanged only as the
Markdown link destination.

Render component counts compactly, omitting zero-valued component types. Use
`None` when no companion catalogs are needed and `Documented` otherwise; the
repository README remains the source for the actual URLs.

## Step 6 - Create a Draft Pull Request

Create one draft pull request.

This repository-owned gh-aw maintenance workflow does not perform the contributor
open-PR count check or request confirmation. After successful validation and
allowed catalog/docs file updates, emit the configured draft `create_pull_request`
safe output regardless of the submitter's or filing account's open PR count.

- New entry branch:
  `community/${{ github.event.issue.number }}-add-<bundle-id>-bundle`
- Update branch:
  `community/${{ github.event.issue.number }}-update-<bundle-id>-bundle`
- New title: `Add <Bundle Name> bundle to community catalog`
- Update title: `Update <Bundle Name> bundle to v<version>`

The commit and PR description must summarize the catalog and documentation
changes, list the validation results, include
`Closes #${{ github.event.issue.number }}`, and mention the submitter with
`cc @<issue-author>`.

End the commit message with this authorship trailer:

```text
Assisted-by: GitHub Copilot (model: <name-if-known>, autonomous)
```

## Important Rules

- Modify only `bundles/catalog.community.json` and
  `docs/community/bundles.md`.
- Keep JSON entries sorted by ID and documentation rows sorted by name.
- Never set a community bundle's `verified` field to true.
- Never add, enable, or change the policy of a submitted catalog.
- Never describe validation as a security audit or endorsement.
- Use `Closes`, not `Fixes`, for the submission issue.
