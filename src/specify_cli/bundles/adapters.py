"""Concrete adapters: catalog fetching and primitive installation.

These wire the bundler's injectable seams to the real environment:

* :func:`make_catalog_fetcher` returns an offline-first fetcher that reads
  built-in catalogs and local/pinned file URLs without network, and falls back
  to a timeout-bounded HTTP GET only for ``http(s)://`` sources.
* :class:`DefaultPrimitiveInstaller` dispatches component install/remove to the
  existing Spec Kit primitive machinery in-process.
