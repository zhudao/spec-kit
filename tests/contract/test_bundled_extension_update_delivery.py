"""Contract tests: previously stale bundled installs are now offered an update.

Every bundled extension shipped at 1.0.0 from its creation while its content
kept changing, so installed copies were reported "Up to date" forever
(#4345). The version bumps in extensions/*/extension.yml and the synced
extensions/catalog.json are what finally make `specify extension update`
offer those installs a newer version, and the local-package route installs
it from the copy bundled with the running spec-kit.

Unit tests cover that route with synthetic extensions and versions, and the
version contract only checks catalog/manifest equality. These tests close
the gap with the real data: install each bundled extension's real source
at the pre-bump 1.0.0, run `extension update` against the real catalog
entry and the real bundled copy, and assert it reaches the catalog version.
