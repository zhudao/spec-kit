# Authentication

Specify CLI uses **opt-in authentication** for HTTP requests to catalog
sources, extension downloads, and release checks.  No credentials are
sent unless you explicitly configure them.

## Configuration

Create `~/.specify/auth.json` to enable authentication:

```json
{
  "providers": [
    {
      "hosts": ["github.com", "api.github.com", "raw.githubusercontent.com", "codeload.github.com"],
      "provider": "github",
      "auth": "bearer",
      "token_env": "GH_TOKEN"
    }
  ]
}
```

> **Security:** Restrict the file to owner-only access:
>
> ```bash
> chmod 600 ~/.specify/auth.json
> ```

Without this file, all HTTP requests are unauthenticated.

## Fields

Each entry in the `providers` array has the following fields:

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `hosts` | Yes | Array of hostnames this entry applies to. Supports exact hostnames, or a leading `*.` wildcard for subdomains only (for example, `*.visualstudio.com`). `*.visualstudio.com` matches `foo.visualstudio.com`, but not `visualstudio.com`. Other glob patterns such as `*github.com` or `gith?b.com` are not supported. |
| `provider` | Yes | Built-in provider key: `github`, `azure-devops`, or `bitbucket`. |
| `auth` | Yes | Auth scheme (see below). |
| `token` | No | Token value (inline). Use `token_env` instead when possible. |
| `token_env` | No | Environment variable name to read the token from. |
| `username` | For `basic` | Username half of a Basic credential — for Bitbucket API tokens, the Atlassian account email. Must not contain `:`. |

For `azure-ad` auth, additional fields are required:

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `tenant_id` | Yes | Azure AD tenant ID. |
| `client_id` | Yes | Service principal client ID. |
| `client_secret_env` | Yes | Environment variable containing the client secret. |

Either `token` or `token_env` must be set for the `bearer`, `basic-pat`, and `basic` schemes.

## Providers and auth schemes

### GitHub (`github`)

| Scheme | Header | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `bearer` | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | PATs, fine-grained PATs, OAuth tokens, GitHub App tokens |

**Example — PAT via environment variable:**

```json
{
  "hosts": ["github.com", "api.github.com", "raw.githubusercontent.com", "codeload.github.com"],
  "provider": "github",
  "auth": "bearer",
  "token_env": "GH_TOKEN"
}
```

### GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES)

To use a private catalog or extension hosted on a GitHub Enterprise Server
instance, add a `github` entry listing your GHES host(s). The same entry
authenticates both catalog JSON fetches **and** private release-asset
downloads — Specify recognizes the listed hosts as GitHub Enterprise and
resolves release downloads through the GHES REST API (`/api/v3`).

```json
{
  "providers": [
    {
      "hosts": ["ghes.example.com", "raw.ghes.example.com", "codeload.ghes.example.com"],
      "provider": "github",
      "auth": "bearer",
      "token_env": "GH_ENTERPRISE_TOKEN"
    }
  ]
}
```

List the **bare** web host (e.g. `ghes.example.com`) — release-download URLs
live there. If your instance uses subdomain isolation, also list the `raw.`
and `codeload.` subdomains your catalog/extension URLs use. A
`*.ghes.example.com` wildcard matches subdomains but **not** the bare host,
so always include the bare host explicitly.

### Azure DevOps (`azure-devops`)

| Scheme | Header | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `basic-pat` | `Authorization: Basic base64(:<PAT>)` | Personal Access Tokens |
| `bearer` | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | Pre-acquired OAuth / Azure AD tokens |
| `azure-cli` | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | Token acquired via `az account get-access-token` |
| `azure-ad` | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | Token acquired via OAuth2 client credentials flow |

**Example — PAT via environment variable:**

```json
{
  "hosts": ["dev.azure.com"],
  "provider": "azure-devops",
  "auth": "basic-pat",
  "token_env": "AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT"
}
```

**Example — Azure CLI (interactive login):**

```json
{
  "hosts": ["dev.azure.com"],
  "provider": "azure-devops",
  "auth": "azure-cli"
}
```

Requires `az login` to have been run beforehand.

**Example — Azure AD service principal (CI/automation):**

```json
{
  "hosts": ["dev.azure.com"],
  "provider": "azure-devops",
  "auth": "azure-ad",
  "tenant_id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "client_id": "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
  "client_secret_env": "AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET"
}
```

### Bitbucket (`bitbucket`)

| Scheme | Header | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `bearer` | `Authorization: Bearer <token>` | Repository / project / workspace access tokens, or Atlassian API tokens sent without the account email (Bitbucket Cloud, **`api.bitbucket.org` only** — see note below); HTTP access tokens (Bitbucket Data Center) |
| `basic` | `Authorization: Basic base64(<username>:<token>)` | Atlassian API tokens (username = Atlassian account email) against `api.bitbucket.org`. Bitbucket Cloud app passwords were removed by Atlassian on July 28, 2026 — use an API token or an access token instead. |

> **Host note:** Bitbucket Cloud splits its surface by host. `api.bitbucket.org`
> accepts repository/project/workspace access tokens as Bearer, and
> Atlassian API tokens either as Basic (with the account email as the
> username) or as Bearer (no email needed), on any REST call, including
> fetching a catalog file via
> `GET /2.0/repositories/<workspace>/<repo>/src/<ref>/<path>`. The plain
> `bitbucket.org` web host (browser pages, `.../raw/...` links, `git clone`
> over HTTPS) does **not** accept either of those — it authenticates
> git-over-HTTPS with HTTP Basic using the literal username `x-token-auth`
> and the access token as the password. Point catalog and `download_url`
> entries at `api.bitbucket.org` (below) rather than `bitbucket.org/.../raw/...`
> so the credentials in your `auth.json` actually apply.

**Example — Bitbucket Cloud access token (recommended):**

```json
{
  "hosts": ["api.bitbucket.org"],
  "provider": "bitbucket",
  "auth": "bearer",
  "token_env": "BITBUCKET_ACCESS_TOKEN"
}
```

Create the token with the **Repositories: Read** scope on the repository
(or project/workspace) that hosts your catalogs and archives. Fetch a
catalog file with this credential via
`https://api.bitbucket.org/2.0/repositories/<workspace>/<repo>/src/<ref>/catalog.json`
rather than a `bitbucket.org/.../raw/...` URL.

**Example — Atlassian API token (Basic auth):**

```json
{
  "hosts": ["api.bitbucket.org"],
  "provider": "bitbucket",
  "auth": "basic",
  "username": "you@example.com",
  "token_env": "ATLASSIAN_API_TOKEN"
}
```

**Example — Bitbucket Data Center HTTP access token:**

```json
{
  "hosts": ["bitbucket.example.com"],
  "provider": "bitbucket",
  "auth": "bearer",
  "token_env": "BITBUCKET_DC_TOKEN"
}
```

> **Note:** Bitbucket Cloud serves file downloads (the repository
> **Downloads** section) via a redirect to a pre-signed Amazon S3 URL.
> Specify strips the `Authorization` header on that redirect because the
> target leaves your declared hosts — this is expected and the download
> still succeeds, since the S3 URL is self-authorizing. Pin a `sha256` in
> your catalog entries so the unauthenticated final hop stays
> integrity-checked.

## Multiple entries

You can configure multiple entries for different hosts or organizations:

```json
{
  "providers": [
    {
      "hosts": ["github.com", "api.github.com", "raw.githubusercontent.com", "codeload.github.com"],
      "provider": "github",
      "auth": "bearer",
      "token_env": "GH_TOKEN"
    },
    {
      "hosts": ["dev.azure.com"],
      "provider": "azure-devops",
      "auth": "basic-pat",
      "token_env": "AZURE_DEVOPS_PAT"
    }
  ]
}
```

## How it works

1. For each outbound HTTP request, the URL hostname is matched against
   the `hosts` patterns in `auth.json`.
2. If a match is found, the corresponding provider resolves the token
   and attaches the appropriate `Authorization` header.
3. If the request receives a 401 or 403, the next matching entry is tried.
4. After all matching entries are exhausted, an unauthenticated request
   is attempted as a final fallback.
5. On redirects, the `Authorization` header is stripped if the redirect
   target leaves the entry's declared hosts — preventing credential
   leakage to CDNs or third-party services.

## Template

A reference `auth.json` with GitHub pre-configured:

```json
{
  "providers": [
    {
      "hosts": [
        "github.com",
        "api.github.com",
        "raw.githubusercontent.com",
        "codeload.github.com"
      ],
      "provider": "github",
      "auth": "bearer",
      "token_env": "GH_TOKEN"
    }
  ]
}
```

To use it:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.specify
# Copy the JSON above into ~/.specify/auth.json
chmod 600 ~/.specify/auth.json
```
